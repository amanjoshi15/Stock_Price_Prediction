# Stock_Price_Prediction
## Indroduction:-
A Machine Learning model to check if the prices of the stock increase or decrease using NLP,  various ML algorithms like Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and some preprocessing techniques like Stemming, Lemmetization, TF/IDF Vectorization and Count Vectorization achieving a maximum accuracy of 85.98%.
